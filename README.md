# Instructions for using the SNP-Slice package

This repository contains the implementation of the SNP-Slice algorithm, which is a Bayesian nonparametric method to resolve multi-strain infections. You can find the motivation of this problem, description of the algorithm, as well as our results in the Bioarxiv preprint titled "SNP-Slice Resolves Mixed Infections: Simultaneously Unveiling Strain Haplotypes and Linking Them to Hosts" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.29.551098v2).
